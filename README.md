## 🌱 About Me  
- I’m a **Statistician in the pharmaceutical industry **, passionate about **science**, **drug development**, and **health & medicine research**.  
- I always find my roots in **math and data**.
- I am a heavy coffee drinker, an animal lover, an easy-going person, and a trustworthy friend. My husband thinks I complain about life too much, but honestly, I feel I’m doing just fine as a mid-aged woman. 


My work focuses on **Bayesian modeling**, **dynamic borrowing**, and **innovative clinical trial designs** to make drug development research smarter, faster, and more informative.

## 🔬 Professional Focus  
- **Therapeutic Area**: Cardiometabolic Health (obesity, diabetes, heart failure, ASCVD). Immunology (rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, atopic dermatitis)
- **Expertise**: Bayesian adaptive design, dose–response modeling, evidence synthesis  
- **Collaboration**: Ongoing research with **Indiana University (Prof. Yong Zang)** on adaptive borrowing and robust prior specification  
- **Goal**: Bridge rigorous statistical methods and practical decision-making in drug development
