## 🌱 About Me  
- I’m a Statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, passionate about science, drug development, and health & medicine research.  
- I always find my roots in math and data.
- I am a heavy coffee drinker, an animal lover, an easy-going person, and a trustworthy friend.
- My husband thinks I complain about life too much, but honestly, I feel I’m doing just fine as a mid-aged woman. 


As a statistician, I am interested in Bayesian modeling, dynamic borrowing, risk-benefit assessment,  and innovative clinical trial designs to make drug development research smarter, faster, and more informative.  

As a drug developer, I am interested in tracking the landscape and chasing new findings in the field.

- **Goal**: Bridge rigorous statistical methods and practical decision-making in drug development

# 💭 Thoughts on Drug Development

It’s been bothering me lately how **resource-consuming** the whole process of drug development is. I love the evidence-based way things are done — and as a statistician, that’s basically why I have such a good job — but it still feels crazy that it takes **10–12 years on average** for a drug to go from discovery to approval [(American Pharmaceutical Review)](https://www.americanpharmaceuticalreview.com/Featured-Articles/594397-The-Lifecycle-from-Drug-Development-Through-Approval-Processes/#:~:text=The%20average%20lifecycle%20of%20drug,about%2010%20to%2012%20years.).

I grew up in **China**, where herbal medicine has a long history and a lot of treatments are passed down through generations. Sometimes it’s literally, “your grandma heard from her neighbor’s grandma that this herb works.” I respect that kind of shared experience — it’s part of our culture — but at the same time, it always made me uncomfortable that there isn’t **solid clinical validation** behind much of it.

So I keep asking myself: how can we make the whole process better?  
No matter the starting point — traditional or modern — the goal is the same:  
**get effective treatments to people faster**, and **make information sharing and tracking more open and complete**.

Maybe the answer lies in using **real-world data**, **real-world evidence**, or **seamless trial designs**.  
I’ve been thinking and working a lot about **seamless design and data borrowing** lately, and it’s becoming a big focus for me.
